# Task 6: Write tests

## Objective
In this task, write tests for our service and component.

---

You can run the tests by executing `ng test`.

Inside the root folder of your project there should be a `coverage` folder now. 

Open the `index.html` in your browser and click through the components to see which parts of your code still need to be tested.
